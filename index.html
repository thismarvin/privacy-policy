            This privacy policy applies to all mobile games and applications developed by Team AM Squared.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our applications are available for free on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. We monetize our products
            through the use of advertisements and In-App Purchases that remove said advertisements. We strive to implement
            advertisements in a rewarding and non-obstructive matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your privacy is very important to us; outlined below is an explanation of how our products handle your privacy.

        <h3>Use and Collection of Personal Data</h3>

            not collect or store any personal data from any of our users.

            third-party vendors that our applications use.
